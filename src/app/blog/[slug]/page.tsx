              If you're a homeowner, you've likely dealt with a slow or clogged drain at some point. 
              While it may seem like a minor inconvenience, clogged drains can lead to bigger plumbing 
              problems if ignored. That's why regular drain cleaning is one of the most important parts 
              of residential plumbing maintenance.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Signature Plumbing, we help homeowners across the GTA keep their plumbing systems 
              running smoothly—and that starts with clean, clog-free drains.
            </p>

            <h2>What Causes Clogged Drains?</h2>
            <p>
              Drains naturally collect buildup over time. In the kitchen, it's often grease, food scraps, 
              and cooking oil. In the bathroom, hair, soap scum, and toothpaste are common culprits. 
              Even your laundry room drains can collect dirt, detergent residue, and fabric lint.
            </p>

            <p>
              Without proper cleaning, this debris sticks to the inside of your pipes, slowly reducing 
              water flow and eventually causing a complete blockage.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Regular Drain Cleaning Matters</h2>
            <p>Here's why scheduling regular professional drain cleaning is worth it:</p>

            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>
              <li>
                <strong>✅ Prevent Costly Clogs</strong>
                <p>Clogged drains can cause backups, overflows, and even water damage. Routine cleaning helps you avoid emergency plumbing repairs.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>✅ Eliminate Bad Odors</strong>
                <p>Organic material stuck in your pipes can begin to rot, leading to unpleasant smells coming from your drains. Drain cleaning removes this buildup and eliminates the odor at the source.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>✅ Improve Water Flow</strong>
                <p>Slow drains are often the first sign of a blockage. Regular cleaning keeps your water flowing freely through every pipe and fixture.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>✅ Extend the Life of Your Plumbing System</strong>
                <p>Buildup and blockages put added stress on your pipes. Keeping them clean reduces wear and tear, helping your plumbing last longer.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Often Should You Clean Your Drains?</h2>
            <p>
              We recommend professional drain cleaning once a year as part of your regular home maintenance 
              routine. However, if you notice any of the following signs, it may be time to call a plumber sooner:
            </p>

            <ul className={styles.warningSigns}>
              <li>Water draining slowly in sinks, tubs, or showers</li>
              <li>Frequent clogs</li>
              <li>Gurgling sounds from your pipes</li>
              <li>Foul smells coming from your drains</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>DIY vs. Professional Drain Cleaning</h2>
            <p>
              While DIY methods like baking soda and vinegar can help with minor buildup, they don't fully 
              clean your pipes. Professional plumbers use equipment like drain snakes and hydro-jetting 
              machines to safely and effectively remove stubborn clogs and debris.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hiring a licensed plumber ensures the job is done thoroughly—without damaging your plumbing system.
