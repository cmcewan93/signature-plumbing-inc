              Your sewer line plays a critical role in keeping waste safely out of your Etobicoke home. With our area's 
              aging infrastructure, tree root intrusion, and seasonal weather changes, sewer line issues are common. 
              At Signature Plumbing, we've helped countless homeowners across Etobicoke, Toronto, and the GTA address 
              sewer line problems before they become major emergencies.

            <h2>Common Sewer Line Issues in Etobicoke</h2>
            <p>
              In our area, several factors contribute to sewer line problems:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>
              <li>
                <strong>Tree Root Intrusion</strong>
                Many Etobicoke neighborhoods have mature trees whose roots can invade sewer lines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aging Infrastructure</strong>
                Older homes in our area often have clay or cast iron pipes that are prone to deterioration.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ground Shifting</strong>
                Our freeze-thaw cycles can cause ground movement that damages sewer lines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Grease Buildup</strong>
                Improper disposal of cooking oils and fats can lead to blockages in our sewer system.
              </li>
            </ul>
