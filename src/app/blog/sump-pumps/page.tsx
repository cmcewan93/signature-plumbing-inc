            <h2>Why Sump Pumps Are Essential in Etobicoke</h2>
            <p>
              Our area's unique conditions make sump pumps particularly important:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>
              <li>
                <strong>High Water Table</strong>
                Many Etobicoke neighborhoods have high water tables that can lead to basement flooding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Heavy Rainfall</strong>
                Our area experiences significant rainfall, especially during spring and summer months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spring Thaw</strong>
                Rapid snowmelt can overwhelm drainage systems and lead to basement flooding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Older Infrastructure</strong>
                Many Etobicoke homes have aging drainage systems that may not handle modern water volumes.
              </li>
            </ul>
