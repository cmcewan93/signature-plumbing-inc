            <p>
              Your water heater is one of the most important appliances in your Etobicoke home, providing hot water for 
              showers, laundry, and dishes. With our cold Canadian winters and hard water conditions, proper maintenance 
              is crucial to extend your water heater's lifespan and maintain efficiency. At Signature Plumbing, we've been 
              helping homeowners across Etobicoke, Toronto, and the GTA keep their water heaters running optimally for years.
            </p>

            <h2>Regular Maintenance Tasks for GTA Homes</h2>
            <p>
              In the Greater Toronto Area, where water quality and temperature fluctuations can impact your water heater's 
              performance, regular maintenance is essential. Here are the key tasks we recommend for Etobicoke homeowners:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>
              <li>
                <strong>Annual Flushing</strong>
                Our hard water conditions in Etobicoke can lead to mineral buildup. Regular flushing helps prevent sediment 
                accumulation and maintains efficiency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anode Rod Inspection</strong>
                Due to our water quality, anode rods in Etobicoke homes typically need replacement every 3-5 years to prevent 
                tank corrosion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Temperature Setting</strong>
                We recommend setting your water heater to 120°F (49°C) for optimal efficiency and safety in our climate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pressure Relief Valve Testing</strong>
                Regular testing ensures your system can handle pressure fluctuations common in our area.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Insulation Check</strong>
                Proper insulation is crucial for Etobicoke winters to prevent heat loss and reduce energy costs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Signs Your Water Heater Needs Attention</h2>
            <p>
              In Etobicoke's climate, watch for these warning signs that your water heater may need professional service:

            <ul className={styles.warningSigns}>
              <li>Rust-colored water (common in older Etobicoke homes)</li>
              <li>Unusual noises from the tank (often due to sediment buildup)</li>
              <li>Inconsistent water temperature</li>

              <li>Water pooling around the base of the unit</li>

              When it's time to replace your water heater in Etobicoke, consider these local factors:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>

                Look for ENERGY STAR® certified models to maximize savings on Toronto Hydro bills.

                <strong>Size Requirements</strong>
