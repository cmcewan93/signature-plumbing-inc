            <h2>Common Plumbing Issues in Etobicoke Homes</h2>
            <p>
              In our area, certain plumbing problems are more prevalent due to our climate and housing stock:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.benefitsList}>
              <li>
                <strong>Leaky Faucets</strong>
                Common in older Etobicoke homes, these can waste significant water and increase your utility bills.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Running Toilets</strong>
                Often caused by worn-out flappers or fill valves, especially in homes with hard water.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low Water Pressure</strong>

              <li>
                <strong>Dripping Showerheads</strong>
                Common in homes with mineral buildup from our hard water conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clogged Drains</strong>
                Tree roots and aging pipes in older neighborhoods can lead to frequent blockages.
